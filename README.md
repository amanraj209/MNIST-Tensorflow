# MNIST IMAGE CLASSIFICATION

This project tests the accuracy of Softmax Regression implemented using Tensorflow on the MNIST database.

## MNIST Dataset

The **MNIST Database** is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.

The data base is also widely used for training and testing in the field of Machine Learning. It was created by "re-mixing" the samples from NIST's original database.

The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. 

The original Black And White images from NIST were size normalized to fit in a 20x20 pixel box while preserving their aspect ratio.The resulting images contain grey levels as a result of the anti-aliasing technique used by the normalization algorithm. the images were centered in a 28x28 image by computing the center of mass of the pixels, and translating the image so as to position this point at the center of the 28x28 field.

Download the MNIST dataset from [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

Check out [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) docs for more API information.

**NOTE:** Install [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) first.
